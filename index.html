            <h3> Recipes Your Way is an interactive meal prep website that lets you discover recipes using ingredients that are readily available. We frequently come across recipes that we would enjoy, only to discover that we do not have half of the ingredients specified. This website aims you eliminate that process by working with the ingredients you already have. </h3>
            <h3> In our fast-paced lives, it can frequently be difficult to set aside time to make balanced meals, no matter how vital they are for our health, which often leads to takeout. Furthermore, after a long day at work or after class, we lack the energy to go buy certain ingredients for a dish we plan to prepare. This website helps you keep healthy and have a complete meal with ingredients you already have on hand. </h3>
            <h3> Similar to how ChatGPT works, where you ask a question and Gen AI responds, Recipes Your Way will provide a list of recipes depending on the ingredients you select. The main difference is that instead of Gen AI, this website use APIs and lines of code. </h3>
